		<h1>Altirra Build Instructions</h1>
		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<h3>Build machine</h3>
		<p>
			Windows 7 x64 or newer is recommended as the build OS. Windows 8.1 x64 and
			Windows 10 x64 have been tested as of this writing. XP and Vista are not
			supported due to IDE/compiler requirements. Building from an x86 system should
			work but is not tested or recommended, particularly since the x64 build
			cannot be tested on such a system.
		</p>
		<h3>Compiler</h3>
		<p>
			The official build environment is Visual Studio 2013 Professional Update 5.
			VS2015 Professional and Community Update 1 are also supported and can also be used.
            (As of this writing, the dev enviroment is actually VS2015u1 building with the
            VS2013u4 compiler.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Visual C++ Express for Desktop can be used with a couple of caveats. The Windows SDK
			is required for the Win32/COM build environment and the resource editor is
			not available. Note that this is not a tested configuration and Community or Professional
            Edition is recommended instead.
		</p>
        <p>
            The GCC/MinGW and Clang compilers are not currently supported and will not work.
        </p>
		<h3>
			DirectX SDK
		</h3>
		<p>
			The latest standalone distribution of the DirectX SDK, June 2010, is required.
			The Windows 8 SDK is not sufficient as it does not include D3DX9. The development
			runtime must be installed on the build machine as the build process compiles shaders.
		</p>
		<h3>Additional Tools</h3>
		<p>
			YASM 1.3.0 is needed for x86/x64 assembly language modules. (<a href="http://yasm.tortall.net/">http://yasm.tortall.net/</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			MADS 1.9.8 is needed for 6502 assembly language modules. (<a href="http://mads.atari8.info/">http://mads.atari8.info/</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			Newer versions of these tools should work but have not been tested. Older versions should be avoided;
            some older versions of MADS, for instance, will either fail to build the AltirraOS kernel or will
            introduce subtle corruption into floating point constants in the math pack.
		</p>
		<p>
			The HTML Help 1.4 toolkit is required to build the help file. It should be automatically installed
            with recent versions of Visual Studio. If not, it is available as a separate download from Microsoft.
		</p>
		<h2>Build environment setup</h2>
		<h3>Build location</h3>
		<p>
			Altirra is designed to build in arbitrary locations, but don't
			attempt to build it under a path that has spaces. This hasn't been tested and
			may fail if some paths are not quoted. Attempting to do so is simply asking for
			unnecessary trouble.
		</p>
		<h3>Platform setup</h3>
        <p>
            The <tt>PlatformSetup.props</tt> file controls the platform toolset that is used to build the
            programs. The normal Visual Studio dialog to offering to upgrade the projects to the newest
            compiler has been inhibited to prevent the converter from breaking this setup. If you still
            receive this dialog, <b>do not upgrade the projects through it.</b> This will break the
            toolchain switching setup in the projects. The <tt>PlatformSetup.props</tt> file should be
            used to switch the toolchain instead.
        </p>
		<p>
			The build initially comes set to use the VS2013 compiler with XP targeting enabled
			(<tt>v120_xp</tt>). Either the VS2013 or VS2015 IDE can be used with this toolchain. To use
			the VS2015 compiler, edit PlatformSetup.props to select <tt>v140_xp</tt> instead. Note that
			Visual Studio should be restarted after editing any .props file manually as the IDE
			does not reliably recognize external changes to property files.
		</p>
		<p>
			The makefile-based projects will report (Visual Studio 2013) regardless; this is
			due to a Visual Studio quirk and can be ignored, as those projects do not actually
			use the C++ toolchain and will build even if the VS2013 toolchain is not installed.
            If necessary to improve cosmetics, the label may be removed by manually editing
            the <tt>.vcxproj</tt> file to match the version of the Visual Studio IDE in use.
		</p>
		<h3>External SDK/tools setup</h3>
		<p>
			By default, the build process will attempt to source the DirectX SDK from the user
			props and the assemblers from PATH.
		</p>
		<p>
			To change the DirectX SDK location, edit
			DirectXSDK.props in a text editor to uncomment the compile/link settings and specify
			the required paths.
		</p>
		<p>
			To change the YASM location, edit the command line templates in YASM.props.
		</p>
		<p>
			To change the MADS location, edit the MADS variable in the two Makefiles.
		</p>
		<h2>Building</h2>
		<h3>First time</h3>
		<p>
			The Release x86 configuration should be built first in a new environment as it
			is necessary to prebuild tools that are used in all configurations. After the build
			tools have been built once, any other configuration/platform can be built. This
			is necessary because the x64 build uses x86 tools to enable cross-compilation.
		</p>
		<h3>Build targets</h3>
		<p>
			There are three targets that can be built from the two solution files:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Altirra:</b> This is the main computer emulator.</li>
			<li><b>AltirraShell:</b> This is the device emulator.</li>
			<li><b>ATHelpFile:</b> Help file for the computer emulator.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For the emulators, three configurations are supported: Debug (unoptimized),
			Profile (optimized), and Release (LTCG).
		</p>
		<h3>Output locations and debugging setup</h3>
		<p>
			In general, compilation outputs go to the <tt>obj</tt> folder, library
			outputs to <tt>lib</tt>, and executables to <tt>out</tt>. A few files are also
			built into <tt>autogen</tt> folders within the projects. The end projects
			are set up to automatically default to the correct executable location to
			start debugging.
		</p>
		<h3>Possible failures</h3>
        <p>
            Link failures usually mean that an upstream project or file failed to build.
            Visual Studio has an unfortunate tendency to uselessly attempt linking a project
            whose dependencies have failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If assembly language (<tt>.asm</tt>) files are failing to build, i.e. YASM
            returning a non-zero error code, this usually means that you don't have the
            path to YASM set up correctly.
        </p>
		<p>
			<tt>asuka.exe</tt> will fail to run in the build if the DirectX Developer
			Runtime is not installed or the version of D3DX associated with the DirectX
			SDK being used is not installed.
		</p>
		<h3>Release script</h3>
		<p>
			For shipping builds, the release script (<tt>release.cmd</tt>) automates the process
			of generating and packaging a clean build. It is invoked in a Visual C++ build environment
			with the name of the version being released. The release script automatically
			injects the version string into the source tree, triggers a clean build, and then
			packages the result in the publish directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			The release script checks the version of <tt>cl.exe</tt> available in the PATH and
			will fail if it is not VS2013 Update 4. Use <tt>/anyvc</tt> to bypass this check and
			force the current compiler to be used.
		</p>
		<p>
			The packaging step requires the Info-Zip archiver (<tt>zip.exe</tt>) and the repacking tool
            advancecomp (<tt>advzip.exe</tt>) to generate the final .zip files.
		</p>
        <h2>Deployment</h2>
		<h3>Licensing</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Please note that Altirra is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or above.
				All rebuilt versions of it must be distributed under compatible conditions.
			</b>
			The source code for the rebuilt version must be made available per the terms of the GPL for any released binaries.
			This is true even for pre-release versions.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few source code files have licenses that are more permissive than the GPL, and
			may be used as such on their own. This only applies to the files that have a block
			comment at the top describing the more permissive license option.
		</p>
		<h3>Third party content</h3>
		<p>
			The following third party content is present in Altirra with the following licences, believed to be GPL-compatible:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><tt>system\source\hash.cpp</tt>: MurmurHash3 (public domain; see source for reference)</li>
			<li><tt>Kasumi\data\Tuffy.ttf</tt>: Tuffy TrueType font (public domain; see Tuffy.txt for reference)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In addition, the built-in kernel contains a copy of the Atari system bitmap font. This is believed
			to not be copyrightable, but concerned parties should consult a qualified legal advisor for the
			pertinent jurisdictions as the author cannot provide legal assurance. No other parts of the Atari system ROMs are
			included or derived from in the included source.
		</p>
		<p>
			Altirra does not link with the Microsoft D3DX library. It is used in the build, but only the build
			tools link to D3DX and the outputs are used without it.
		</p>
		<h3>Deployment dependencies</h3>
		<p>
			Altirra is statically linked against all necessary runtimes. In particular, neither the
			DirectX nor Visual C++ Redistributable are needed with the final executable regardless of
			OS.
