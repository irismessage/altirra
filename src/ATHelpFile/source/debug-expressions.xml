<topic title="Addresses and expressions">
  <p>
    Many debugger commands take addresses or expressions as arguments.
  </p>
  <toc/>
  <h2>Addresses</h2>
  <p>
    Simple addresses can be either specified in default base, as set by the <tt>.base</tt>
    command, or in hex using a <tt>$</tt> prefix. The default base is <tt>mixed</tt>, which
    selects hex for simple addresses and decimal for numbers in expressions.
  </p>
  <h3>Global addressing</h3>
  <p>
    For commands that support global addressing, 24-bit and alternate memory space addresses
    can be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    65C816 24-bit addresses can be specified in bank+offset form using a <tt>:</tt> to separate
    the bank and offset, e.g. <tt>$01:0000</tt>. A <tt>$</tt> prefix selects hex for both
    the bank and the offset together.
  </p>
  <p>
    PORTB-based extended memory can be addressed in two ways. The <tt>x:</tt> prefix
    linearly addresses extended memory, while <tt>$xx'yyyy</tt> syntax addresses it using
    the PORTB value and CPU address. For instance, <tt>$EF'4000</tt> maps to the extended
    memory visible to the CPU at <tt>$4000</tt> with a PORTB value of <tt>$EF</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additional prefixes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>n:</tt></b> selects ANTIC address space</li>
    <li><b><tt>v:</tt></b> selects VBXE memory by VBXE linear address</li>
    <li><b><tt>r:</tt></b> selects main memory by CPU address, even if currently shadowed by ROM or hardware</li>
    <li><b><tt>rom:</tt></b> selects system ROM by CPU address, even if currently disabled or shadowed by hardware</li>
    <li><b><tt>cart:</tt></b> selects cartridge memory with linear addressing</li>
    <li><b><tt>t:$xx'yyyy</tt></b> selects cartridge memory with banked addressing, e.g. <tt>t:$02'A000</tt> accesses $A000 with a bank value of $02. (This is currently only supported with the AtariMax cartridge types.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Expressions</h2>
  <h3>Constants</h3>
  <p>
    Constants may be specified in the default base, base 16 (hex), or base 2 (binary).
    Hex numbers are preceeded by <tt>$</tt> and binary numbers by <tt>%</tt>. In mixed base
    mode, expressions beyond a simple address use decimal constants.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <tt>:</tt> may be used to select an alternate address space or a banked 24-bit
    address.
  </p>
  <h3>Grouping</h3>
  <p>
    Parentheses <tt>()</tt> are used to group subexpressions. They do not request memory
    indirection in the debugger as they do in 6502 assembly language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Grouping parentheses can also be used to force expression evaluation instead of
    address evaluation.
  </p>
  <h3>Arithmetic operators</h3>
  <p>
    The <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>/</tt>, and <tt>%</tt> operators
    perform arithmetic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
    modulus, respectively. All arithmetic is performed according to 32-bit, two's complement
    signed integer rules.
  </p>
  <h3>Relational and logical operators</h3>
  <p>
    <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>, <tt>=</tt>, and
    <tt>!=</tt> binary operators compare two values, evaluating to 0 for false and
    1 for true. Note that unlike C-inspired programming languages, the equality operator
    is a single <tt>=</tt> and not <tt>==</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <tt>and</tt> and <tt>or</tt> perform logical AND or OR combination and evaluate to
    1 if both arguments and/or non-zero and 0 otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The unary <tt>!</tt> operator does logical inversion, evaluating to 1 if the argument
    is zero and 0 otherwise.
  </p>
  <h3>Bitwise operators</h3>
  <p>
    <tt>&amp;</tt>, <tt>|</tt>, and <tt>^</tt> are bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operators.
    <tt>~</tt> is bitwise inversion.
  </p>
  <h3>Low and high byte operators</h3>
  <p>
    <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> are unary operators that return the low and high
    bytes of a 16-bit argument. They operate similarly to the low and high byte prefixes
    used in 6502 assembly language.
  </p>
  <h3>Memory access operators</h3>
  <p>
    The <tt>db</tt>, <tt>dsb</tt>, and <tt>dw</tt> unary operators read an unsigned byte,
    signed byte, and unsigned word from memory given an address.
  </p>
  <h3>CPU register operators</h3>
  <p>
    The <tt>pc</tt>, <tt>a</tt>, <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, <tt>s</tt>, and <tt>p</tt> operators
    return the values of the corresponding CPU registers. In 65C816 mode, the
    low bytes of the A, X, Y, and S registers are returned.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The <tt>a</tt> operator is overridden by the hex value <tt>$a</tt> if mixed base
    mode is enabled. This only happens in expressions that contain only <tt>a</tt> and nothing else.
    Use <tt>(a)</tt> or <tt>@a</tt> to force the operator instead.
  </p>
  <h3>ANTIC register operators</h3>
  <p>
    <tt>hpos</tt> and <tt>vpos</tt>
    return the horizontal and vertical beam positions.
  </p>
  <h3>Breakpoint context operators</h3>
  <p>
    The <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> operators refer to the current memory read or
    write address and are used in the address tests of a memory breakpoint. They are only
    valid within a breakpoint condition expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a breakpoint filter expression or when executing commands from a breakpoint
    action, the <tt>address</tt> operator returns the memory access address and
    the <tt>value</tt> operator returns the value read or written to memory.
  </p>
  <h2>Length expressions</h2>
  <p>
    Commands that operate on a memory range take a length parameter which begins
    with <tt>L</tt>, which indicates the length of the range in bytes:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <tt>f 4000 L1000 00 01 02 03</tt>
    <br/>
    <tt>f $1600 L($a00+x) 00 01 02 03</tt>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The form <tt>L&gt;</tt> can also be used to set the length based on an
    inclusive end address rather than a byte count:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <tt>f 4000 L>4FFF 00 01 02 03</tt>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Note that this takes priority over the high-byte expression operator. Parentheses
    can be used to force the operator:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <tt>f pagetable L(>bytes) 00 01 02 03</tt>
  </blockquote>
