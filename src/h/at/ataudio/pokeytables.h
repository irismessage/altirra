	// steps for all channels. The last part takes advantage of the measurement for bit 3
	// being close enough to twice bit 2 that we can combine the two to reduce table size.
	// With this formulation, the POKEY channel volume levels can be translated to index
	// deltas that are just added together.
	//

	// 12 of a single channel, and negation, so the output is the same polarity as on
	// the actual hardware (POKEY pulls down from ~4.80V).
