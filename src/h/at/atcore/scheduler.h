// The scheduler's job is to maintain a timer queue for simulation events. It is among one of
// the most time-critical pieces of the emulator since the main scheduler instance runs at
// machine cycle speed and is therefore called extremely frequently. For instance, when
// POKEY IRQs are enabled, an event is scheduled each time the timer rolls over. As such, it
// is important that the scheduler be fast both at dispatching events and also at adding
// and removing them.
//
// The emulator maintains two schedulers, one at cycle speed (1.79MHz) and another at scanline
// speed (15.7KHz). The second is used for events that have much longer delays and have lower
// precision requirements, thus lowering the load on the fast scheduler.
//
// The scheduler also maintains the master cycle clock of the system. One use for this is to
// maintain time delays passively by means of timestamp deltas, where the timestamp advances
// at 1.79MHz rate. This avoids the need to schedule events entirely. The disk drive emulation
// code does this to track disk rotation, since nothing actually needs to happen directly on the
// index mark. Scheduler time is always monotonic, even when save states are restored.
//
// == Wrap warning ==
// Differencing timestamps is a powerful and low-cost way to manage delays. However, at
// machine cycle rate (1.79MHz), the 32-bit counter wraps in 20 minutes. At turbo speeds this
// can be less than a minute of real time. This means that systems that use this technique
// need to handle wrapping. One way is to get a periodic callback to ensure that any really
// old timestamps are caught up. The other way is to use GetTick64() to use a 64-bit timestamp.
