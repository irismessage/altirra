//=========================================================================
// Snapshot system
//
// Snapshots hold state captured non-destructively from live objects and
// allow that state to be persisted and later restored. Snapshots are a
// middle ground between serialization and object cloning. They allow for
// persistence like serialization, but are meant to be more efficient to
// create and manipulate; at the same time, they are not live objects like
// clones would be. The snapshot system also cannot recreate an object
// graph, only mirror state into an existing one.
//
// The implementation of snapshots involves mirroring state from a live
// object graph into a snapshot object graph. The snapshot objects are
// designed to lightweight, often directly copied versions of memory
// structures. For instance, the snapshot of device memory may simply be
// a wrapped memory buffer. Once captured, the snapshot may then be
// persisted for offline storage. Snapshot objects in memory are opaque
// and assumed valid; validation and versioning are therefore deferred
// until serialization.
//
// Snapshot objects support equality comparison and hashing operations to
// aid with deduplication, since it is highly likely for some objects to
// not change between snapshots. For instance, a peripheral with 512K of
// device memory may not have been accessed between snapshots.
//
// It is also possible to difference two snapshot objects of the same type
// to produce a delta object. This is advantageous for memory buffers that
// are large but only change in portions. Differencing two full objects
// produces a delta object and adding a delta object to a full object
// produces another full object. The difference operation may simply
// result in a full object if it isn't supported or is non-advantageous
// (delta encoding a single int is pointless). Deltas cannot be
// serialized and are not validated.
//
// Snapshot objects are assumed to be matched to their runtime objects and
// are not dynamically type checked.
