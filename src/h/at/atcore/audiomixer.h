// Synchronous audio mixer output
//
// The synchronous audio mixer combines audio from multiple sources in
// emulation synchronous time. The mixer divides time into discrete mixing
// chunks and then polls all sources to mix audio into the buffer for each
// chunk. This is always done after the emulation time has passed. More
// details are in audiosource.h.
//
// For simple looping or one-shot sounds, the mixer also provides a sample
// player that automatically tracks sound lifetimes.

// Convolution player
//
// The convolution player is a special subclass of the regular sample player that
// mixes copies of a single sound by FFT convolution instead of regular sample mixing.
// It is significantly faster when hundreds of instances of the same sound sample
// are played in the same audio frame.
//
// Considerations:
//
// - There is a cost of 1 2K FFT per audio frame per convolution player that has
//   impulses, and another FFT for the output when any impulses are present. Thus,
//   convolution players are slower until around dozens of sounds are played
//   per frame. However, convolution players have a very low cost per sound, and
//   there is no cost for convolution players that do not currently have impulses.
//
// - Each convolution player can only handle one sample. (Convolution players will
//   be shared if allocated for stock samples.)
//
// - Sounds are limited to 2560 samples.
//
// - Convolution players can be used both on the normal and edge sample players.
//   Edge convolution players are useful for convolving samples with square waves.
//
// - Convolution players currently only support samples played within the current
//   audio frame. They cannot be used to play sounds more than one frame in the
//   future.
//
// - Sounds cannot be stopped on a convolution player. Once a sound has started,
//   it must play to completion.

//	- The edge player takes care of downsampling from 1.7MHz to 64KHz.
//
// Unlike the sample player, the edge player does not allow future buffering of edges. Edges
// can only be submitted during the mixing process within the current frame. The edge player
// will accommodate edges slightly beyond the mixing window but beyond the cycle window,
// automatically carrying them over to the next mixing frame. This avoids the need for
// callers to buffer edges between the end of the mixing frame and the end of the simulation
// frame.
//
// The edge player takes advantage of the fact that the end of the mixing pipeline has a
// high-pass filter which normally consists of a differencing stage followed by an
// integration stage. The edge player is inserted between the two, allowing it to take
// advantage of 'free' integration.
