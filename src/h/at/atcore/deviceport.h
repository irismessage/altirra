// Device controller port interface
//
// The device port manager provides access to the joystick ports. Both
// inputs and outputs can be connected.
//
// The PIA interface is similar to the device port interface, except that
// the PIA interface is intended for internal devices. It should be used
// instead of the device port interface when internal access to port B is
// required on XL/XE configurations, which are not accessible through the
// device port manager since port 3/4 don't exist.

// Controller port interface
//
// Interface for devices designed to hook up to one of the external
// controller ports in the computer, ports 1-4 for the 400/800 models
// and 1-2 for the XL/XE models. This includes the joystick direction
// lines, joystick trigger line, and paddle inputs.
//
// Each device obtains its own controller port interfaces for the ports
// it is connected to. Behind the scenes, the port manager merges the
// values from all of the port interfaces. While it isn't normally
// expected that more than one device would connect to the same port,
// this is supported to allow for graceful transitions between device
// configurations without requiring strict remove-add ordering of
// overlapping devices.
//
// Direction signals are stored as 4-bit masks using the same bit
// ordering and polarity as the PORTA/PORTB registers. In order, bits
// 0-3 correspond to up, down, left and right joystick inputs, with a
// '0' when that input is active.
//
// The controller port interface is referenced counted and is freed
// by releasing the last reference. While normally the controller ports
// should be freed before the port manager shuts down, the port manager
// will neutralize all outstanding controller port instances at its
// shutdown so that they turn into no-ops.
