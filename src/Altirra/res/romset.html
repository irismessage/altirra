    <h1>Altirra ROM image set</h1>
    <p>
      This ROM image set consists of the following five files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="mono">atbasic.rom</span> (Altirra 8K BASIC)</li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-800.rom</span> (AltirraOS for 400/800 Computers)</li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-xl.rom</span> (AltirraOS for XL/XE/XEGS Computers)</li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-5200.rom</span> (AltirraOS for 5200 SuperSystem)</li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-816.rom</span> (AltirraOS for 65C816 Accelerators)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are replacements for the standard Atari ROMs that would normally be present in these
      systems; they are not the original ROMs, but new ones rewritten from scratch to match the
      same programming interface without the original code. They may be used in either real
      hardware or in emulators with sufficient accuracy. The mapping to standard filenames
      expected by most emulators is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="mono">atbasic.rom -&gt; ATARIBAS.ROM</span></li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-800.rom -&gt; ATARIOSB.ROM</span></li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-xl.rom, altirraos-816.rom -&gt; ATARIXL.ROM / ATARIXEGS.ROM</span></li>
      <li><span class="mono">altirraos-5200.rom -&gt; ATARI5200.ROM</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      On real hardware, you will need a way to burn or flash replacement ROMs, such as an EPROM
      burner, 32-in-1 OS switcher, or Ultimate1MB. For Altirra 8K BASIC, there is a soft-loadable
      version of the interpreter on the Additions disk that comes with Altirra.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Please note:</b> The replacement ROMs have been written to support software that conforms
      to Atari's original specifications for usage of public variables and entry points into the
      firmware ROMs. Software that makes use of undocumented entry points or behaviors from the
      original OS and BASIC ROMs may not work with these ROMs. An attempt has been made to achieve
      reasonably high compatibility, but some programs have hardcoded assumptions that cannot work
      with such a replacement ROM and will only run on the original firmware.
    </p>
    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>
      This ROM image set package is produced by the Tools &gt; Export ROM Set command of the Altirra emulator.
      Newer versions of the emulator include updated versions of the ROM set.
    </p>
    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>
      The license for all files in the ROM set is the following all-permissive license:
